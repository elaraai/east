# Devdocs

This folder contains "living documentation" for the East language project.

In the ideal case the markdown files here represent a language specification for East.
In practice, they cover a lot of in-progress and recently completed design work.

 - INTERFACES.md: a listing of the user-facing interface for the Expr builders and stdlib
 - SERIALIZATIN.md: basics of East's serialization format
 - SERIALIZATION_ALIASING.md: an extension of the serialization format to support circular references in recursive types, and preservation of mutable aliasing
